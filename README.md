This study aims to compare GPT-based techniques to standard Natural Language Processing (NLP) in terms of efficacy for sentiment analysis in financial news headlines. The goals include evaluating accuracy, determining areas for potential enhancement, and comparing the effectiveness of the two approaches. The techniques include integrating the GPT-3.5-turbo model via the OpenAI API and utilizing a variety of conventional machine-learning algorithms. Important results show that XGBoost outperforms GPT in terms of accuracy and that classical NLP excels in sentiment analysis. The study emphasizes the challenges that traditional algorithms have when attempting to provide sentiment explanations, in addition to the domain-specific limitations that come with GPT-based methods. The project has significantly impacted decision-making tools, shaped conversations about the use of AI-powered sentiment analysis, and influenced risk management, investor confidence, industry practices, and policy creation.
